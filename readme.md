A repository for my debut year of 2023 in Advent of Code. Let's see how long I gonna last.

My goal: complete as many puzzles as I will be able to until 23th December (40 parts are my personal target).
Outcome: I have managed to complete all the puzzles until 15th December, but due to private life matters (and rising difficulty) I haven't found time to finish the rest afterwards. In result I've finished the Advent of Code with 31 parts finished, which is lower than my initial target, nevertheless I have found it to be a quite enjoying way to learn & refresh some concepts.
