A repository for my debut year of 2023 in Advent of Code. Let's see how long I gonna last.

I sometimes copied and altered others code when I was feeling stuck and/or felt rushed and had little time to develop own satisfying solution. However I never copied any solutions 1:1, but adjusted it to the existing codebase I've created. Any such occurrences are marked in code comments.
